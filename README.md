# Genetic Algorithm - Neural Network (GANN)
Using concepts of Genetic Algorithm to update the weights of Neural Network.

## Description
This project combines Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Neural Networks (NN) to optimize the weights of a neural network. The goal is to leverage the evolutionary strategies of genetic algorithms to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for the weights of the neural network, which can often be challenging to achieve through traditional training methods.

## Features
- Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to optimize neural network weights.
- Customizable parameters for GA such as population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate.
- Supports various neural network architectures and activation functions.

## Repository Structure
`ga_nn.py`: Contains the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm.
`artificialNeuralNet.py`: Contains the implementation of the Neural Network.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).
